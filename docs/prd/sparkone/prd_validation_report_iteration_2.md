2. **Backlog Cross-References Complete** ‚úÖ
   - All 37 items now have TraceIDs mapped to PRD requirements
   - All applicable items have ADR references
   - Zero UNASSIGNED entries remain

3. **PRD Structure Synchronized** ‚úÖ
   - Added "Especifica√ß√£o de API" section to PT-BR (matches EN-US)

## Remaining Issues

### HIGH Priority (Score Impact: -5 points)

1. **Minor Structural Differences PT-BR vs EN-US** (-3 points)
   - **Location:** Overall document structure
   - **Issue:** EN-US has "Implementation Status Matrix" (lines 410-423) not fully mirrored in PT-BR
   - **Fix Required:** Add Implementation Status Matrix table to PT-BR PRD

2. **Acceptance Criteria Still Generic** (-2 points)
   - **Location:** PRD.pt-BR.md lines 222-225, PRD.en-US.md lines 299-305
   - **Issue:** RNF-012 through RNF-015 lack measurable criteria
   - **Fix Required:** Add specific, testable criteria for compatibility requirements

### MEDIUM Priority (Score Impact: -3 points)

3. **ADR Pending Decisions Need Owners** (-2 points)
   - **Location:** decisions.md lines 403-426
   - **Issue:** PD-001 through PD-004 lack assigned owners and target dates
   - **Fix Required:** Assign team members and Q1/Q2 2025 targets

4. **Minor Line Count Discrepancy** (-1 point)
   - **Location:** PT-BR (545 lines) vs EN-US (602 lines)
   - **Issue:** 57-line difference, some content still not perfectly aligned
   - **Fix Required:** Final pass to ensure 1:1 parity

## Summary

**Strengths:**
1. ‚úÖ **Perfect traceability** - all requirements mapped to backlog and code
2. ‚úÖ **Complete backlog** - all items have proper references
3. ‚úÖ **Excellent architecture coherence** - clear status for all components
4. ‚úÖ **Consistent IDs** - zero cross-reference errors
5. ‚úÖ **Strong glossary** - all terms defined and consistent

**Remaining Weaknesses:**
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor PT-BR/EN-US structural gaps (Implementation Status Matrix)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Generic acceptance criteria for compatibility requirements
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending ADRs need owners and timelines

**Recommendations:**
1. **Quick win:** Add Implementation Status Matrix to PT-BR (+2 points, 10 min)
2. **Short-term:** Add measurable NFR criteria (+2 points, 30 min)
3. **Medium-term:** Complete pending ADRs with owners (+3 points, 1 hour)

## Next Steps

### For Iteration 3 (Target: 95/100):
1. Add Implementation Status Matrix to PT-BR
2. Add specific acceptance criteria to RNF-012 through RNF-015
3. Re-validate

### For Iteration 4 (Target: 100/100 - FREEZE):
1. Complete pending ADRs with owners and dates
2. Final bilingual alignment pass
3. Generate freeze report
