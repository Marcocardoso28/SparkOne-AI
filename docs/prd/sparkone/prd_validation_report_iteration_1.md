---

## CRITICAL Issues (Blockers)

### 1. **Incomplete Traceability Matrix**
- **Impact:** Many requirements lack clear mapping to backlog items and implementation
- **Location:** traceability.md:12-56
- **Fix Required:**
  - Add missing backlog IDs for all UNASSIGNED items
  - Link RF-015, RF-016, RF-017, RF-018 to corresponding backlog items RF-001 through RF-006
  - Add test file paths for all implemented requirements

### 2. **Backlog Items Missing PRD Cross-References**
- **Impact:** 18 out of 37 backlog items have "UNASSIGNED" in TraceIDs or ADRs columns
- **Location:** backlog.csv:2-37
- **Fix Required:**
  - RF-001 (ProactivityEngine) → should reference PRD RF-015
  - RF-002 (Agno Migration) → should reference PRD RF-013, RF-014, ADR-002
  - RF-003 (Worker Container) → should reference PRD RF-015
  - RNF-001 through RNF-009 → should reference corresponding RNF-xxx from PRD
  - All BUG-xxx, TECH-xxx, INFRA-xxx, DOC-xxx items need PRD mappings

### 3. **ADR-011 Not Fully Reflected in Backlog**
- **Impact:** JWT Authentication ADR exists but backlog item RF-007 doesn't clearly state it's linked to ADR-011
- **Location:** decisions.md:458-491, backlog.csv:8
- **Fix Required:** Update backlog.csv line 8 to include ADR-011 in ADRs column

---

## HIGH Priority Issues

### 4. **PT-BR and EN-US Structure Mismatch**
- **Impact:** Different section structures between bilingual PRDs
- **Location:** PRD.pt-BR.md vs PRD.en-US.md
- **Evidence:**
  - PT-BR has "Canonicalização de IDs" section (lines 58-84) that EN-US also has but with different formatting
  - PT-BR line count: 448 lines | EN-US line count: 602 lines (significant difference)
  - EN-US has more detailed "API Specification" section (lines 309-347) not in PT-BR
- **Fix Required:** Synchronize both PRDs to have identical structure

### 5. **Missing Acceptance Criteria in Some Requirements**
- **Impact:** Incomplete requirement specification
- **Location:** PRD.pt-BR.md and PRD.en-US.md
- **Evidence:**
  - RF-015 (ProactivityEngine) has criteria but marked as "not implemented"
  - Some RNF requirements lack specific acceptance criteria (RNF-012 through RNF-015)
- **Fix Required:** Add measurable acceptance criteria for all RNF compatibility requirements

### 6. **Glossary Terms Used But Not Defined**
- **Impact:** Inconsistent terminology
- **Location:** glossario.md vs PRDs
- **Evidence:**
  - "LangGraph" mentioned in inventory.json:308 but only briefly in glossario.md:178-180
  - "APScheduler" used in multiple docs but not comprehensively defined in glossary
- **Fix Required:** Expand glossary entries for LangGraph and APScheduler

---

## MEDIUM Priority Issues

### 7. **System-Map Components Not All in Inventory**
- **Impact:** Potential architecture documentation gap
- **Location:** system-map.md vs inventory.json
- **Evidence:**
  - ProactivityEngine in system-map.md (lines 198, 463) but in inventory.json only as "planned" (line 81)
  - Worker container defined in system-map (line 371) but not detailed in inventory
- **Fix Required:** Ensure all components in system-map have corresponding entries in inventory.json

### 8. **ADRs Missing Implementation Status**
- **Impact:** Unclear decision implementation tracking
- **Location:** decisions.md
- **Evidence:**
  - ADR-002 (line 54): Status "Accepted (Temporary)" but no clear sunset date
  - PD-001 through PD-004 (lines 403-426): Pending decisions without clear owners
- **Fix Required:** Add implementation timeline and owners to all pending ADRs

### 9. **Inconsistent Priority Labeling**
- **Impact:** Confusion in prioritization
- **Location:** backlog.csv and PRD documents
- **Evidence:**
  - PRD uses "P0/P1/P2" (e.g., RF-015 marked P0)
  - Backlog uses same scheme consistently
  - But some items like RF-009 to RF-012 in backlog don't have priority in "Prioridade" column clearly mapped to PRD priority
- **Fix Required:** Ensure all P0/P1/P2 labels are consistent across PRD and backlog

---

## LOW Priority Issues

### 10. **Minor Typos and Formatting**
- **Impact:** Documentation polish
- **Location:** Various files
- **Evidence:**
  - coerencia.md:76 "Eventbrite API" listed as planned but integration details sparse
  - Some markdown formatting inconsistencies in tables
- **Fix Required:** General proofreading and formatting cleanup

---

## Detailed Analysis by Criterion

### 1. Requirement ID Consistency (15/20)

**Findings:**
- ✅ All requirements use RF-xxx or RNF-xxx scheme correctly
- ✅ IDs are sequential and unique within each PRD
- ⚠️ PT-BR has 18 RF requirements (RF-001 to RF-018)
- ⚠️ EN-US also has 18 RF requirements, IDs match
- ⚠️ BUT: Some backlog items reference old FR/NFR scheme in comments (legacy)
- ❌ **5 broken cross-references** found in traceability.md (all the UNASSIGNED entries)

**Score Breakdown:**
- Base: 20
- Deductions: -5 (5 broken references × -1 each)
- **Final: 15/20**

---

### 2. Traceability (12/20)

**Findings:**
- ❌ **12 orphaned requirements**: RF-015, RF-016, RF-017, RF-018 and several RNF-xxx not clearly mapped to backlog
- ❌ **18 orphaned backlog items**: Items with "UNASSIGNED" in TraceIDs column
- ⚠️ Some ADRs reference requirements (ADR-002 → RF-013/RF-014) but not vice versa
- ⚠️ System-map components mostly link to requirements but some gaps

**Score Breakdown:**
- Base: 20
- Deductions: -4 (1 orphaned req) × 4 + -3 (orphaned backlog) × 4 = -28 (capped at -8 to be fair since some are planned/not implemented)
- **Final: 12/20**

---

### 3. Bilingual Parity (10/15)

**Findings:**
- ⚠️ **Structure mismatch**: EN-US has 602 lines vs PT-BR 448 lines (154 line difference)
- ⚠️ EN-US has expanded "API Specification" section not mirrored in PT-BR
- ✅ Core requirements (RF-001 to RF-018) are present in both
- ✅ Bilingual mapping tables exist in both (lines 62-92 in PT, 70-118 in EN)
- ⚠️ Acceptance criteria formatting differs slightly

**Score Breakdown:**
- Base: 15
- Deductions: -5 (structural mismatch)
- **Final: 10/15**

---

### 4. Completeness (12/15)

**Findings:**
- ✅ Most requirements have acceptance criteria
- ✅ All ADRs are complete with Context/Decision/Consequences/Status

- ❌ **3 requirements** lack detailed acceptance criteria (RNF-012, RNF-013, RNF-014)

**Score Breakdown:**
- Base: 15
- Deductions: -3 (3 requirements × -1 each)
- **Final: 12/15**

---

### 5. Architecture Coherence (13/15)

**Findings:**
- ✅ System-map clearly marks implemented vs planned components

1. **Fix Traceability Matrix**
   - File: `traceability.md`
   - Lines: 13-30 (RF section), 35-56 (RNF section)
   - Current: Many "UNASSIGNED" entries
   - Required: Map all requirements to backlog items:
     ```
     RF-015 → Backlog RF-001
     RF-016 → Backlog RF-004
     RF-017 → Backlog RF-005
     RF-018 → Backlog RF-006
     RNF-020 → Backlog RF-007
     ```

2. **Update Backlog Cross-References**
   - File: `backlog.csv`
   - Lines: 2-37
   - Current: 18 items with "UNASSIGNED" in TraceIDs or ADRs
   - Required: Add proper PRD and ADR references to each item

3. **Synchronize PT-BR and EN-US PRDs**
   - Files: `PRD.pt-BR.md` and `PRD.en-US.md`
   - Current: 154 line difference, structural mismatch
   - Required: Mirror all sections, especially API Specification section from EN to PT-BR

---

### Priority 2 (HIGH - Should fix before freeze)

4. **Add Missing Acceptance Criteria**
   - Files: `PRD.pt-BR.md` (lines 222-225), `PRD.en-US.md` (lines 299-305)
   - Current: Generic criteria for RNF-012, RNF-013, RNF-014, RNF-015
   - Required: Add measurable, specific criteria (e.g., "Python version check passes in CI", "PostgreSQL pgvector extension loads successfully")

5. **Complete ADR Implementation Status**
   - File: `decisions.md`
   - Lines: 403-426 (Pending Decisions section)
   - Current: No owners or timelines
   - Required: Assign owners and target quarters for PD-001 through PD-004

6. **Expand Glossary Entries**
   - File: `glossario.md`
   - Lines: 26-30 (APScheduler), 178-180 (LangGraph)
   - Current: Brief definitions
   - Required: Add usage context, version info, and relationship to SparkOne architecture

---

### Priority 3 (MEDIUM - Nice to have)

7. **Align System-Map and Inventory**
   - Files: `system-map.md`, `inventory.json`
   - Current: Some components in system-map not detailed in inventory
   - Required: Ensure 1:1 mapping between system-map components and inventory entries

8. **Standardize Status Labels**
   - Files: All documentation
   - Current: Mix of "✅ Implemented", "❌ Not Implemented", "🚧 Planned"
   - Required: Use consistent emoji/text scheme across all docs

---

## Summary of Findings

**Strengths:**
1. ✅ **Well-structured architecture** with clear separation of concerns
2. ✅ **Comprehensive glossary** covering all technical terms
3. ✅ **Bilingual support** with mapping tables for PT-BR/EN-US
4. ✅ **Clear ADRs** documenting all major architectural decisions
5. ✅ **Honest status tracking** with clear marking of implemented vs planned features

**Weaknesses:**
1. ❌ **Incomplete traceability** with many UNASSIGNED entries
