## Prevention Measures Recommended

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ✅ Add git pre-commit hook to check PRD line counts
2. ✅ Add CI check: alert if PT-BR/EN-US line count diff > 50 lines
3. ✅ Document PRD update process

### Short-term (This Month)
1. ✅ Create automated validation script
2. ✅ Add weekly PRD health check to CI/CD
3. ✅ Implement file size monitoring

### Long-term (This Quarter)
1. ✅ Set up automated translation validation
2. ✅ Implement PRD version tagging system
3. ✅ Create PRD change request template

---

## Next Steps

### For Continued Maintenance

1. **Monitor PRD Health**
   - Run automated validation weekly
   - Check line count parity (PT-BR vs EN-US < 50 lines diff)
   - Verify all sections present in both languages

2. **Update Process**
   - Always update both PT-BR and EN-US simultaneously
   - Use this validation report as baseline reference
   - Re-run validation after any PRD changes

3. **Baseline Protection**
   - Consider git tag: `baseline-v1.0-restored-2025-10-03`
   - Protect main branch for PRD files
   - Require validation before merging PRD changes
