You are a PRD validation expert. Analyze the SparkOne project documentation and provide a comprehensive validation report.

FILES TO ANALYZE:
- PRD.pt-BR.md (Portuguese PRD)
- PRD.en-US.md (English PRD)
- backlog.csv (Product backlog)
- decisions.md (Architecture Decision Records)
- system-map.md (System architecture map)
- inventory.json (Component inventory)
- glossario.md (Glossary)
- coerencia.md (Coherence analysis)
- traceability.md (Traceability matrix)

VALIDATION CRITERIA:

1. **Requirement ID Consistency (20 points)**
   - All requirements must have unique IDs (RF-xxx for functional, RNF-xxx for non-functional)
   - IDs must match exactly between PT-BR and EN-US versions
   - No duplicate or missing IDs

2. **Traceability (20 points)**
   - Every PRD requirement must be traceable to backlog items
   - ADRs must reference specific requirements
   - System-map components must link to requirements
   - Inventory must align with system-map

3. **Bilingual Parity (15 points)**
   - PT-BR and EN-US must have identical structure
   - All sections, requirements, and acceptance criteria must match
   - Technical terms must be consistent with glossario.md

4. **Completeness (15 points)**
   - All requirements must have acceptance criteria
   - All ADRs must be complete (Context, Decision, Consequences, Status)
   - No TODOs or placeholders in production docs

5. **Architecture Coherence (15 points)**
   - System-map must reflect actual implementation
   - No ghost services (documented but not implemented)
   - No undocumented services (implemented but not in docs)
   - Vector Search, JWT Auth, ProactivityEngine status must be clear

6. **Backlog Quality (10 points)**
   - All items must reference PRD IDs
   - All items must reference ADRs where applicable
   - Priorities must be set
   - Estimates must be present

7. **Glossary Consistency (5 points)**
   - All technical terms in PRDs must be in glossario.md
   - Definitions must be consistent across documents
